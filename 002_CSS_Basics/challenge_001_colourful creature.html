    <h1>All About Green Nature</h1>
    <p>Green is the quintessential colour of nature - of parks, gardens and forests, and a reminder of the life-giving power of plants. For animals, it's a complicated colour to produce using pigments. <br>
        Green is the color of life, reflected in nature as a sign of renewal. As a bright, positive color, green has many cultural meanings in religion and art. <br>
        Green is much more than a color. It has come to symbolize our natural environment and the planet Earth and how important it is to safeguard them for our own benefit and that of future generations.</p>
