    <h1>Never Be Stagnant In Learning</h1>
    <p><strong>Learning</strong> makes us better people,<br>
        And gives us the <em>power</em> to conquer our world.</p>
        
    <p>Do not let <em>classroom</em> <em>education,</em><br>
        Makes you feel you have gotten it all;<br>
        Remember what you know in class,<br>
        Is just 30% of shared knowledge;<br>
        And the remaining 70% worth of <em>education,</em><br>
        You get them through constant <em>self-learning.</em></p>
        
        <p>What you discover by yourself,<br>
        Is only what will live within your heart;<br>
        And this would only be made possible,<br>
        If you subject yourself to <em>constant reading.</em></p>
        
        <p>Deep knowledge is gotten,<br>
        When we persistently read;<br>
        <strong>Deep learning,</strong> gives us a broader view of life,<br>
        And how to deal with different kinds of people;<br>
        That would forever constantly come your way.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Self-learning</strong> is a <em>character builder</em>,<br>
        Anyone who seeks to be happy;<br>
        In all such would ever seek to do,<br>
        Should learn to make her a true friend.</p>
        
        <p>Get all the <em>qualifications</em> you ever need,<br>
        But if you fail to educate yourself;</p>
        
        <p>Through daily <em>continuous learning,</em><br>
        Then you have forever <em>limited yourself;</em><br>
        Within the confinement of limitation.</p>
