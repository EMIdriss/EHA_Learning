    <h1>Never Be Stagnant In Learning</h1>
    <p>Learning makes us better people,<br>
        And gives us the power to conquer our world.</p>
        
    <p>Do not let classroom education,<br>
        Makes you feel you have gotten it all;<br>
        Remember what you know in class,<br>
        Is just 30% of shared knowledge;<br>
        And the remaining 70% worth of education,<br>
        You get them through constant self-learning.</p>
        
        <p>What you discover by yourself,<br>
        Is only what will live within your heart;<br>
        And this would only be made possible,<br>
        If you subject yourself to constant reading.</p>
        
        <p>Deep knowledge is gotten,<br>
        When we persistently read;<br>
        Deep learning, gives us a broader view of life,<br>
        And how to deal with different kinds of people;<br>
        That would forever constantly come your way.</p>
        
        <p>Self-learning is a character builder,<br>
        Anyone who seeks to be happy;<br>
        In all such would ever seek to do,<br>
        Should learn to make her a true friend.</p>
        
        <p>Get all the qualifications you ever need,<br>
        But if you fail to educate yourself;</p>
        
        <p>Through daily continuous learning,<br>
        Then you have forever limited yourself;<br>
        Within the confinement of limitation.</p>
