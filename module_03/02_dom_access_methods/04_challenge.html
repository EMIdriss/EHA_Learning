Step 1- Add a script tag. This webpage has HTML tags and CSS, but no JS in it yet. Add a <script> tag to the bottom, so that you can manipulate the webpage with JS.
Step 2- Replace the webpage with JS. Inside the <script> tag, use the line of code that we showed you to replace the contents of the webpage with a custom message instead - it can say whatever you want, as long as it's a few letters long. We'll explain more about how that line of code works in the next talk-through.
Step 3 - Push your codes to your Github.
